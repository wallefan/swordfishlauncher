            # its filesystem type as fusefs, and so do a lot of other things.  We can't discriminate based on filesystem
            # size or free space because then there would be no way to distinguish between a laptop's 1TB internal data

            # is their flashdrive.  Unfortunately, I know firsthand that this is not the case, both from myself at age
            # 12 and from my sisters.  And that's leaving MacOS completely out of the picture.
